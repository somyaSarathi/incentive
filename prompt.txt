Generate {} random titles and descriptions for Azure IT Requests. These requests typically involve users seeking help with connecting to Power BI servers, accessing Arcos servers, or linking datasets (e.g., ADX, API, Databricks, SharePoint, etc.) to Power BI. Ensure the output includes intentional spelling mistakes or incorrect capitalization to make it appear more human-like and casual.

Human-Like Tone:
- Introduce minor spelling errors or capitalization mistakes to simulate natural typing errors. Examples:
  - Replace “can’t” with “cant,” “Please” with “Pls,” or “access” with “acess.”
- Use a casual tone, as if written by users encountering issues. Examples:
  - “I keep getting this error.”
  - “Can someone fix this asap?”
  - “I think I need permissions for this.”

Output Requirements:
- Provide the response strictly in JSON format.
- Double-check all JSON syntax, including delimiters, brackets, and overall structure, to ensure correctness.
- Use the following JSON structure:

Expected Output template:
```json
[
    {
        "title": "title 1",
        "description": "description 1"
    },
    {
        "title": "title 2",
        "description": "description 2"
    },
    {
        "title": "title 3",
        "description": "description 3"
    }
]
```

Important Notes:
1. Ensure the JSON syntax is valid and conforms to the expected structure.
2. Verify the use of correct delimiters and parentheses.
3. Titles and descriptions should reflect typical Azure IT requests and include human-like typos and informal language.
